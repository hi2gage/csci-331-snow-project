**Do not use the main branch for develoment**



Creating new branch and jumping into it 
```
git co -b <branch-name>
```

Adding all changes to staging
```
git add .
```

Committing all changes to your branch
```
git commit -m "message tell us about what your changed"
```

Pushing your branch back to Github so we can review the changes
```
git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
git push
```



Finally we will be using GitHub to manage all of the merges.
